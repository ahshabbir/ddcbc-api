# ddcbc_api
A basic API for controlling brightness via ddcutil api, and a basic CLI interface implemented for it.The CLi is equivalent to typing ddcutil setvcp, however it makes it easier if you have multiple monitors, as in my case. In the future, I hope to create a gtk interface for this, as well as an xfce4-panel extension.
